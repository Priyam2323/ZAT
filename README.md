# ZAT: Zero-Anomaly Training for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection 
Zero-Anomaly Training (ZAT) with Laplacian of Gaussian GANs enables fully unsupervised anomaly detection in chest X-rays, learning only from normal samples without requiring labeled anomalies. The proposed architecture integrates multi-scale feature extraction, a novel Fourier Loss for better structural similarity, and an attention module to enhance detection accuracy and minimize false positives.

##Dataset 
This work utilizes the COVIDx dataset, a publicly available collection of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 detection, accessible via the following link: https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net

## Installation

Step 1:
```python setup.py install```

 Step 2 :
 ```python train_wgangp_gdea.py "path_to_traindata" --img_size 128```
 
 Step 3:
 ``` python train_encoder_izif_gdea.py "path_to_traindata" --img_size 128```
 
 Step 4: 
 ```python test_anomaly_detection.py "path_to_testdata" --img_size 128```
 
 Step 5:
 This repository provides pretrained models for medical image anomaly detection. Users can evaluate the models on test data available using collab file - Final_ZAT_graph.ipynb
 The evaluation results, including ROC-AUC metrics, can be examined through this Google Colab notebook. The notebook reads the prediction CSV files generated by the models and provides detailed interpretation and visualization of the performance metrics.
 The test data downloaded from COVIDx after post-preprocessing, is hosted separately and can be accessed from the following external drive link for evaluation purposes:
